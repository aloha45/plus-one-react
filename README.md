# Plus One #

A dating app matching system clone that takes in user data to build a dating profile and matches them to others. 

## Notes ##

As a dating app user, and someone fascinated by multi-faceted applications coming together to form a cogent product, I was drawn to the idea of building a dating app. 

Dating apps are actually multiple applications running ascynchronously with each other to form a single program that appears synchronous. There is the initial set-up: logging in, creating a profile, and answering questions that carve out your space in the algorithm to be sent potential matches. Then, there is a matching game, which is what this project intends to be, where you are sent profiles to potential matches and you either "like" them or "pass" on them. Then, there is a messaging program that allows two users to communicate with each other. Within each of those applications are a number of features, but this project is focused on the middle step and what I think is the core UX of any dating app: liking people you like and passing on those that you don't.

Any successful dating app has a function, niche, or theme that it really focuses on. Plus One pulls on two APIs: one for finding a picture and another for pulling randomly generated data for fake people and puts them together as a dry run at API library calls coalescing in a single card that can be liked or passed on.

User selects are logged in arrays so that prior "nope" and "yep" matches can be stored, reviewed, and eventually messaged.

In 2019, 30.4 million users logged in to date online, and 25.1m of them did so from their smartphones.
